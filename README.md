<h>The Vehicle Management System</h> In PHP is a simple mini project for managing the vehicles, buses &amp; cars of RUET. In RUET there are many vehicles that can be hired for money. The project contains the admin side and the user side. The admin can control all the vehicle request and check if the request can be granted or not. They can update the driver and vehicle list, add new drivers, add new vehicles, etc. An admin can control the whole booking process from the admin panel like which car to give to a certain user and which driver to drive etc. As a whole, the admin has all the power to control the whole management process.
